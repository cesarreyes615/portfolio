          Project Overview
        </h2>
        <h4>
          I took a 10 week course where I worked with a team of three to create
          a mobile web app centered around the theme of mindfulness. We were
          tasked with creating an app that helped our users be more aware of a
          particular aspect of their lives.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Our application, Manager of Money, is a money budgeting app that is
          aimed at helping college students manage and budget their money
          better. I was mainly responsible for coding the app. I coded most of
          the front end and all of the back end using html, css, and javascript.
          I also helped come up with its features, tested prototypes, and
          deployed them online.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <h4>
        College students need a way to easily keep track of their finances and
        budget in order to make sure they have enough money for basic
        necessities while also being able to practice financial management since
        college students typically arrive at university with little to no
        knowledge of money management while at the same time having a restricted
        supply of money.

      <h2>Storyboards</h2>
      <h4>
        Our team created three storyboards to better demonstrate how our app
        fulfills the needs of our users. Storyboard number one describes how our
        app can help save up for something the user wants. Number two
        demonstrates how proper budgeting gave a user some left over money to
        purchase a game they wanted. Number three shows an example of how
        helpful notifications of upcoming payments would be.

        the help button on the log in page. We did A/B testing through google
        analytics to see if making the help button bigger would effect if it
        received more clicks. We found that the size of the button did not
        increase the number of clicks.
